# THREE.js Non-Inertial Forces

This project is a quick demonstration of how the inertial forces work in a non-inertial reference frame.

## Left view

An overall view of a ball travelling inside a rotating structure, which is thus subject to the fictitious
forces (Coriolis and centrifugal force).

## Right view

A POV view inside the ball to imagine what it feels like (you could actually test it in France at the
Palais de la d√©couverte in Paris)


# How to make it work

To make it work, download the repo, then use the following process: https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally

To sum it up, just run a localhost on your machine (I personally use python -m http.server), then
go to your localhost on your browser and just admire the result.

If you have any suggestion, do not hesitate and leave a comment or a pull request, I'd be happy
to add it to the project.
